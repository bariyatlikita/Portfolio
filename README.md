# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Bariyat Likita

I'm a data analyst with over four years of experience transforming raw data into actionable insights. I specialize in creating dashboards, visualizations, and reports using tools like Power BI, Excel, and Tableau, and I'm expanding my skill set into data science with Python and SQL.

I'm passionate about using data to solve real-world problems, particularly in health, education, and social impact. On this GitHub, you'll find projects that reflect my learning journey, freelance work, and client-facing analyticsâ€”ranging from interactive dashboards to predictive models.

ðŸ“Š Always curious, always learning. Let's connect and build something meaningful with data!
